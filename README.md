# IMEautochange
Good news for Chinese Minecraft players!

This is a Minecraft mod which changes Input Method Editor(IME) automatically(between English and Chinese) during gameplay, freeing you from the need to change it manually in a few frequently encountered situations where text input is needed.

Windows APIs are used in realizing the functions so this mod only works under Windows. In Linux etc, it is expected to do nothing.

This is a client-sided mod, and therefore not required on server.

For Minecraft 1.12.2

Currently supports:

* ingame chat line

* JEI search box (if JEI is installed)

Since these two functions are most frequently used.

# Usage
This mod added a new hotkey binding(default: Enter) to open chat with IME automatically toggled, and it is still possible to open chat with the vanilla Minecraft open-chat hotkey(default: T) with IME remaining unchanged. If the two hotkey collides, the hotkey added by this mod will override the vanilla one.

JEI support can be turned on/off in game by pressing J(default)

* All functional tweaks can be done ingame with hotkeys.
